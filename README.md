# Plagiarism-Detector
The outcome of using this plagiarism detector is that we can compare two text
documents as well as two image files. A similarity score is provided by this
plagiarism detector, and it shows what percentage of the text is similar to that
found in the other source and it also obtains whether the images are replicate of
each other or not. This plagiarism detector prints the plagiarized lines or text
between two files and in images, it highlights the area as rectangle which is
similar in both the images
