Some rivers flow into the ground and dry up before reaching another water body. As rivers flow from highlands to lowlands, they donâ€™t just bring water but also silt. This silt gets deposited on the river banks making the soil extremely fertile. Most of the ancient civilizations like those in Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, and India, settled around rivers as rivers made farming possible.
