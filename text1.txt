A river is a natural watercourse that flows from high altitude to low altitude due to the force of gravity. Rivers usually rise from a mountain or large lake and flow towards an ocean, sea, or another river. They can be perennial rivers that flow throughout the year or seasonal rivers which carry either rainwater or snow water. Some rivers flow into the ground and dry up before reaching another water body. Small rivers are often called streams, brooks, creeks, or rivulets. Many small rivers often join bigger rivers forming their tributaries. Bigger rivers then flow to even bigger water bodies.
